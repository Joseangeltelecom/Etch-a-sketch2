1. 16x16 grid of square divs.

2. Create the divs using JavaScript.

3 Put the square inside another container. (the best)

4. ways: 
float/clear
inline-block
flexbox
CSS Grid

5. Be careful with borders and margins, they can adjust the size of the squares!
6. Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.
Hint: Set up event listener hover.

7.Change de color of a DIV: add a new class to the div or changing the div’s background color using JavaScript.
8. add button to the top to:
 - clear the current grid 
- send a popup (how many squares per side to make the new grid). a new sketch with different side.
- Set the limit for the user input to a maximum of 100. 
- Research button tags in HTML and how you can make a JavaScript function run when one is clicked.
- Also check out prompts
- if I enter 64 into the propmt I'll get 64x64.without changing the total amount of pixels used.

9. (Optional):Instead of just changing the color of your grid from black to white (for example) have each pass through it with the mouse change to a completely random RGB value. Then try having each pass just add another 10% of black to it so that only after 10 passes is the square completely black.
